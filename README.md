# OneLot

## Approach and Explanation

For this coding challenge, I was tasked with building a Next.js application with a pixel-perfect design of the provided screens. I chose to use Tailwind CSS for styling, as it is a modern and popular CSS framework that allows for efficient and customizable styling.

I began by creating a new Next.js project and setting up the basic file structure. I then created components for each section of the design, using Tailwind CSS classes to style the elements. I made sure to write clean, modularized code with comments where necessary, following best practices of development.

To ensure responsiveness, I used Tailwind's responsive design classes to apply different styles for medium, large, and extra-large screen sizes. This allowed me to create a user-friendly and intuitive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.

I have attached a screen recording of the desktop and mobile views of the application, demonstrating its responsiveness and functionality.

## Technical Decisions

I chose to use Tailwind CSS for styling, as it is a popular and efficient CSS framework that allows for customizable styling.
I used Next.js as the framework for building the application, as it is a popular and well-maintained framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
I wrote clean, modularized code with comments where necessary, following best practices of development.

            └── styles.css
    └── tailwind.config.js
    └── tailwind.config.ts

```


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
